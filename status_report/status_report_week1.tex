\section{Status report}

\subsection{Achievement}\label{proposal}

\begin{itemize}
\item Created a directory structure for project and stored in version control on remote private GitHub repository.
\item Created research proposal and project timeline.
\item Read through 4 relevant research papers and briefly summarised each.
\item Stated the Bioinformatics Specialisation course in Coursera to familiarise with bioinformatics and genomic concepts.
\item Came up with 4 different machine learning ways to approach the project, 3 of them being a classification problem and 1 being a regression problem approach.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Questions}\label{progress}

\begin{itemize}
\item Meaning of topic: uncover subtle/hidden clues or indications of the human immune system's influence on virus genomes? Similarities of human T cell genome and virus genome? Must it be between the human immune system cell genome and a virus genome where the virus has attacked that human before?
\item Should I be using supervised or unsupervised learning? Unsupervised learning may be appropriate as we donâ€™t know the similarities between human immune system and virus genome. However, for some similar proteins found for both virus genome and human immune cells, I can use supervised learning. What will be the goal of this? Would it be to figure out types of virus sharing the same protein as those found in human immune cells for virus immunity?
\item Can a model be used to find out all the similar proteins between human immune cell genome and virus genome, and the type of the protein?
\item Is the project only concerned about the impact of the human immune system on the virus genome, and not the other way around?
\item Is my project a research-focused project? Does the goal of this project involve implementing an end to end learning system?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Plan for rest of week 1, and week 2}\label{plan}

\begin{itemize}
\item Create a directory just for relevant research papers and its summaries, and read up on at least 10 more related research papers, summarise the findings and note down which parts of it can also be implemented for my project.
\item Familiarise with bioinformatics concepts - continue the Bioinformatics Specialisation course in Coursera and always keep track of relevant findings.
\item Write the minute on Moodle and review afterwards.
\item Practice implementing different machine learning models for the first time in Python and Jupyter Notebook.
\end{itemize}
