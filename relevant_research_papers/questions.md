- Do we want to predict similarities with human immune system that the virus has or will have, from looking at its genome?
- By footprint, does it mean evidence of human immune system having an influence on the virus genome? e.g. cytidine deaminases like APOBEC3 that edit viral retrogenomes to restrict retroviral infection.
- Am I only concerned about the impact of the human immune system on the virus genome, and not the other way around?
- Effect of evolution of APOBEC3G on evolution of virus genome?
- Can I use deep learning?
- What is my end goal? Do I want to classify viruses into those whose genes have the relevant proteins caused by host immune response and those who don't have those proteins? Do I want to look at the evolution of virus genome from host immune response?
- What data do I even want?
- Should I use unsupervised learning for only those viruses that have the proteins present that are the result of host immune response towards virus or should I use unsupervised learning for all viruses generally.
- 1. what data do I want
  2. what ML approach should I use
- Do immune cells of human hosts from different regions across the world or different age or gender have a difference on how it affects virus genomes?
