- Do we want to predict similarities with human immune system that the virus has or will have, from looking at its genome?
- By footprint, does it mean evidence of human immune system having an influence on the virus genome? e.g. cytidine deaminases like APOBEC3 edit viral retrogenomes to restrict retroviral infection.
- Effect of evolution of APOBEC3G on evolution of virus genome?
