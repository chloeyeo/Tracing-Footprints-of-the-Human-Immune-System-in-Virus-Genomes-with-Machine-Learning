- Do we want to predict similarities with human immune system that the virus has or will have, from looking at its genome?
- By footprint, does it mean evidence of human immune system having an influence on the virus genome? e.g. cytidine deaminases like APOBEC3 edit viral retrogenomes to restrict retroviral infection.
- Effect of evolution of APOBEC3G on evolution of virus genome?
- Can I use deep learning?
- What is my end goal? Do I want to classify viruses into those whose genes have the relevant proteins caused by host immune response and those who don't have those proteins?
- What data do I even want?
