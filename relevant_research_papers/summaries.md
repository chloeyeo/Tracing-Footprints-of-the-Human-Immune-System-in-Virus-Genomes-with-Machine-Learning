### A heterochromatin inducing protein differentially recognizes self versus foreign genomes
### https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009447
Heterochromatin plays a crucial role in gene regulation by repressing gene expression. Changes in chromatin structure, including shifts between heterochromatin and euchromatin states, can impact the expression of immune-related genes. Understanding these chromatin changes may provide insights into how the immune system responds to viruses.

Heterochromatin can affect the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors and other regulatory proteins. Changes in chromatin structure may impact the binding of transcription factors involved in the immune response. Investigating these interactions could be relevant to understanding how the immune system recognizes and responds to viral genomes.

## Paper 2
### Did viruses evolve as a distinct supergroup from common ancestors of cells?
### https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evw175
- No, not enough evidence. This means there is no ancestral relation between human and virus genomes.

## Paper 7
### Conserved Footprints of APOBEC3G on Hypermutated Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 and Human Endogenous Retrovirus HERV-K(HML2) Sequences
### https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.00584-08
#### What did authors try to accomplish
Find, from virus genome including patient-derived hypermutated HIV-1 genomes, signatures of hypermutation, guanine-to-adenine (G-to-A) hypermutation that strongly correlates to the hypermutation induced in vitro by the human polynucleotide cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G (hA3G) which is an antiviral restriction factor that induces this G-to-A hypermutation in retroviruses. This is to demonstrate the involvement of this restriction factor, APOBEC3G (hA3G), in defense against retroviral attacks over millions of years of human evolution.

#### What were the key elements of the approach

#### What can you use yourself
It is the APOBEC3G protein that is the footprint of human immune system found in virus genome.
Outcome: I can find out what type of viruses have this protein found in their genome.
