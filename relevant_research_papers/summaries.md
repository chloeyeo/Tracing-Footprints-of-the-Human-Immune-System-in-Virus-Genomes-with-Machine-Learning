## Paper 1
### A heterochromatin inducing protein differentially recognizes self versus foreign genomes
### DOI: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1009447
Heterochromatin plays a crucial role in gene regulation by repressing gene expression. In the context of the human immune system's response to viral infections, changes in chromatin structure, including shifts between heterochromatin and euchromatin states, can impact the expression of immune-related genes. Understanding these chromatin changes may provide insights into how the immune system responds to viruses.

Heterochromatin formation is associated with specific epigenetic modifications, such as histone methylation and DNA methylation. These modifications can influence gene expression. Investigating the epigenetic changes that occur during the immune response to viruses could be relevant to my project.

Some viruses have evolved mechanisms to manipulate host chromatin structure, including promoting heterochromatin formation, as part of their strategies to evade the host immune response. Understanding how viruses interact with host chromatin can shed light on the dynamics of host-virus interactions.

Heterochromatin can affect the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors and other regulatory proteins. Changes in chromatin structure may impact the binding of transcription factors involved in the immune response. Investigating these interactions could be relevant to understanding how the immune system recognizes and responds to viral genomes.

It is the APOBEC3G protein that is the footprint of human immune system found in virus genome.
Outcome: I can find out what type of viruses have this protein found in their genome.
